	<p>People are walking and driving more now than they were in January, but transit usage is nearly half of what it was. Across the entire United States, requests for <span class="graphic-color-driving">driving directions</span> are up 34 percent from mid-January, and <span class="graphic-color-walking">walking directions</span> are up 18 percent. But <span class="graphic-color-transit">transit routings</span> tell a different story, down 47 percent in that same time period. This is according to the latest round of data from Apple Maps, released as part of its Mobility Trends Reports.</p>

	<p>The below data was assembled by Apple, using requests for directions made by Apple Maps users. Each line measures the percentage change of requests for the three modes, measured from a mid-January baseline.</p>
